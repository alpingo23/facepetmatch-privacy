    <h1>Privacy Policy - Face Pet Match</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Face Pet Match application (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") processes user data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
    <p>The Application does not collect users' photos or personal data. Photos are analyzed solely using the <code>face-api.js</code> library on our servers, and this process occurs entirely on the servers. No data is sent to or stored on local devices.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The analyzed data is processed on servers exclusively for the pet matching feature and is not used for any purpose outside the Application.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The Application does not share any user data with third parties. Photos or analysis results are not exported externally.</p>

    <h2>4. Policy Regarding Children</h2>
    <p>This Application is not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from users under 13, as no data collection occurs on local devices.</p>

    <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Since the Application does not collect data on local devices, users do not need to request data deletion or access. For any questions, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:alpipekciler@gmail.com">alpipekciler@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Updates</h2>
    <p>This policy may be updated as needed. Changes will be announced within the Application.</p>
